# Overview

1.  **JWT-Based Authentication:** Uses JWT for secure, stateless user authentication.
2. **Redis Integration:** Stores and manages tokens in Redis, enabling efficient token revocation (logout, blacklist, etc.) and session management.
3. **Spring Boot Framework:** Leverages the Spring Boot ecosystem for rapid development and configuration.
4. **User Login/Logout:** Provides endpoints for user login, token issuance, and secure logout (token invalidation).
5. **Token Refresh:** Likely implements a refresh mechanism to issue new tokens using a valid refresh token.
6. **Role-Based Access:** Supports role or authority checks for API endpoints using Spring Security.
7. **Security Best Practices:** Implements standard security measures such as password hashing and secure token handling.
