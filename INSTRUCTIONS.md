# Instruction
Act as an expert Senior Backend Engineer and Database Architect with deep experience in Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, who is familiar with developing software for the Indonesian market.

Your task is to design a user management database schema in PostgreSQL.

I want you to approach this strategically. Instead of giving me just one final answer, please follow these steps:
1.  **Propose a Plan:** 
2.  **Present Options:** 
3.  **Analyze and Compare:** For each option, provide a brief analysis covering:
    - Pros (kelebihan)
    - Cons (kekurangan)
    - Best for (skenario penggunaan terbaik)
4.  **Provide a Recommendation:** Recommend the best option for my project context.
5.  **Indonesian Naming Convention:** This is a crucial instruction. For all examples and final code, you **must use Indonesian language** for naming conventions and comments but don't make it silly. This is to ensure the code is maintainable by our local Indonesian team.
6.  **Offer the Next Step:** Conclude by asking me which option to proceed.
